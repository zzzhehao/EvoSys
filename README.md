Note repo for Open Science and for Everyone.

PRs, issues, comments, corrections and contributions are highly welcome. 

## Vision

The ideal state for this repository would be to serve as an introduction to phylogenetics and its reconstruction methods. It should, if possible, provide a basic overview of each topic, along with references to publications and literature for further reading.

## Format

Notes are (and should be, if you are opening a PR) written in pure [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) with relative path used for cross-reference. I used [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) while writing, but ensuring consistent MD formatting allows you to simply use any other MD editor or reader (or, just use GitHub).

No orphan allowed!! All notes should at least be indexed by [00 index](00%20index.md).

## Contribution wanted

Detailed methodology are principally lacking at this point. I have contents regarding MSA, ML, Parsimony, Bayesian Inference, Ancestral state reconstruction, but I rarely have time to organize them into notes. 

**Existing contents need improvement.** I simply shared my notes from a course, but they serve more as "supplementary notes" and lack comprehensive explanations for many key concepts. I **might** work on improving this in the next few months, since I have an upcoming project that requires revisiting these topics, but I would still appreciate any contributions to make this repo more self-explanatory.
