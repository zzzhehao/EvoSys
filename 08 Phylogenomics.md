Principally **phylogenomics** = phylogenetics + more data (e.g. whole genome), BUT â€¦

- effort in assembling datasets decreases data quality, use of automatic tools is inevitable
- phylogenomics are more prone to model misspecification, systematic error can amplify and increases along with alignment length
- hidden paralogy, HGT, ILS, hybridization might be buffered in large datasets or negatively affect tree inference
- more data increasing precision (reduction of stochastic errors) but not necessarily the accuracy
